# Getting help with recon-helpdesk

Thanks for using recon-helpdesk. Before filing an issue, there are a few places
to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/reconhub/recon-helpdesk/issues) to check if anyone
else has already asked your question. 

## Do you have a question about a RECON package? 

Ask away! If you can't find the answer you're looking for, then we will help you
find it :)

## Do you need help with some code?

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the 
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven't heard of or used 
reprex before, you're in for a treat! Seriously, reprex will make all of your 
R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to 
ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). For additional reprex
pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of
the tidyverse site.
